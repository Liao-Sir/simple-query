# SimpleQSï¼š A Simple Qustion Search Engine Based on BM25
![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/stanfordnlp.svg?colorB=blue)

The project is aimed to build a question search engine which can return a list of relevant 
target questions from database once given a specific query. 
It basically fits the full life circle of a typical search engine, which consists of four steps:

* Data Crawling: design a Spyder to crawl data from websites; 
* Database Building: store the crawled data into database by means of inverted index; 
* Sentence Analyzing: conduct grammatical and semantical analysis of each query to capture the 
features of the target questions; and 
* Web Visualizing: search relevant results in database and present them by correlation using visualization through website.

## Requirements
The codebase is implemented in Python 3.6.8 package versions used for development are just below.
```
bs4 == 0.0.4
Flask == 1.1.1
nltk == 3.4.3
tdqm == 4.32.1
```

## Usage
* You need to run the file `code/crawler.py` firstly to get questions from websites, 
or can use `data/que.pkl` directly. 
```bash
crawler(n=1000, core_num=6)
```
n represents how many pages user wants to crawl, and core_num depends on the amount of cpu.
* Then you should run the file `code/db_index.py`. The step will generate a database about key words
based on BM25.
```bash
construct_database(previous_path + '/data/ir.db')
```

* There are only top similar questions retrieve and part of speech tagging functions in sentence analysis, 
and more methods can be added to `web/sent_analysis.pkl`

* `web/main.py` is supposed to run finally, and enter the http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to test the engine.
